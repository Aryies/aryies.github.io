			<p>
				Isolation is an important issue that comes with gaming as well. An individual can spend quite a lot of time on a game that they are playing and begin to ignore their friends and quite possibly their family. This can become a large issue as it means that the individual can become quite anti-social and may not want to interact with other people. This issue can occur if the individual spends large amounts of time playing games, whether it be playing on a console (PlayStation 4, Xbox one, etc.) or if they playing on their mobiles and/or Computers. There have been many accounts of people losing touch with the family and peers for the sake of “completing a level” and it has become an even bigger issue in today’s society.
			</p>
			<p>
				While an individual is playing a game, they may experience “flaming” or bullying online. This can come in various forms and can become quite intense depending on the people the individual talk to online or how popular the game is. If the game itself is quite popular then it is close 100% likely that the individual at one point will experience a type of bullying. This bullying may not as intense as getting bullied by someone who is known by the individual, but it may steal hurt the person as it makes them feel less likely to play outside or even interact with other people. This type of bullying can consist of people online commenting on how “bad” the individual is at the specific game and can even go as far as to say “go die” in some cases. These cases are not uncommon since there is a large variety of people online who play specific games and who may take that game a little too seriously. The individual would need to take digression when deciding to play the game and be ready for these types of people. 
			</p>

			<h1>Our View</h1>
			<p>
				We think that these social issues threaten how others view gaming in general. We think that bullying and/or flaming while playing a game online should not be tolerated, not anywhere! Our view on this is that these social issues can be controlled and/or stopped completely without too much trouble. These issues have caused many other problems, for example there have been cases of individuals being too afraid to leave their house because of a threat they had received online while playing a game. We think that this has gone too far and need to be stopped.

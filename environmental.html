				Gaming can have large effects on the environment as well. An individual could use large amounts of electricity if they end up playing a game for large amounts of time or using multiple electronic devices, which happen to be plugged in. This may occur if the individual has more than one monitor on the computer, or is playing on their console while also using their computer. There are more scenarios, which may occur in these types of situations. It is up to the individuals themselves to make sure that they do not use too much electricity while their playing their games as it may hurt the environment in the long run. The individual, to solve the issue, could regulate a time period in, which they are allowed to play games or use multiple devices at the same time and it may help to solve the issue.
			</p>
			<p>
				As an individual goes on playing games, they may feel that they need a new console or parts for their computer so they may go out to but a new one. This can cause a problem, as the recycling of computers and consoles is fairly difficult. These components may go to waste and my end up being thrown out as rubbish thus hurting the environment. Not all places are able to correctly recycle these types of places, which may cause a problem in the long run once these consoles and computer parts start to pile up and become a hazard to the environment. To help with the alleviation of the problem, the individual could use the console as a “hand-me-down” and give it to a baby sibling or maybe a family friend that they know of. The individual could also “trade it in” and the console and/or parts could be repaired and sold off again to others who may want that particular thing.
			</p>

			<h1>Our View</h1>
			<p>
				We feel as if these environmental issues are completely preventable and should be dealt with the individuals themselves who are responsible. We feel that individuals should be able to recycle their own consoles by possible handing them down to others who may also want that type of console or computer part at hand. We think that this issue is not as big a problem as it is made out to be since they are preventable but nonetheless they are still issues, which need to be dealt with.

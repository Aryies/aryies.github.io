			<h1>Legal Issues</h1>
			<p>
				A legal issue with gaming includes the copyright of ideas. Copyright is a large issue within gaming as it means that ideas from other companies or organizations have been stolen. Individuals who play games may feel that they would like to create their own game with aspects of either their favourite game or a game, which may be popular at the time. Large fines may be given out to individuals who copy the ideas or aspects of other games. Individuals may not be the only ones who are a part of this issue, other companies and/or organisations may be a part of this issue which may result in the company itself being in debt and having to shut down.
			</p>
			<p>
				Piracy is another part of gaming that is a large issue. Individuals who do not pay for a game (supporting the developers), and illegally download a game, are committing piracy. This is a legal issue because it means that the original developers who created the game are not gaining the appropriate amounts of profit from their game. This issue is illegal and can result in a substantial fine from the developers themselves, possibly a court case as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				Privacy of information is an important part of the gaming issue. An individual who plays games would most likely not like their information spread to third party companies as it exposes a lot of things about them. This issue is usually with the individuals and the developers themselves. The developers would have the responsibility to not expose private information if the individual does not want it so and the individual would need to read all of the terms and conditions of the game/company that they are signing up for to be sure that their information will not get exposed to places, which they would not like.
			</p>

			<h1>Our View</h1>
			<p>
				We think that the issues to do with gaming can have arguments for and against certain parts. Piracy may have a justification such as games in today’s society being too expensive, but these things are still illegal nonetheless and appropriate punishments for those who do break these laws should be dealt with appropriately.
